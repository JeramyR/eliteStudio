The design focuses on trust, comfort, and a clean clinical feel to help clients understand available services and confidently book consultations.

## Tech Stack

- React (with Vite)
- Font Awesome for icons
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Husky v9+ and lint-staged for pre-commit linting/formatting
- Deployed via AWS S3 and CloudFront

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/JeramyR/eliteStudio.git
cd eliteStudio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

This installs all required dev tools, UI libraries, and sets up Husky.

### 3. Run the Dev Server

```
npm run dev
```

## Font Awesome Setup

Font Awesome is used for social and functional icons (e.g. Instagram, email, location, etc.).

### Installation

```
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

### Usage Example

```jsx
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faInstagram } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons';

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faInstagram} />;
```

## Code Quality and Formatting

This project enforces clean code using:

- ESLint (Flat config)
- Prettier
- Husky v9+
- lint-staged

### Lint and Format Manually

```
npx eslint . --fix
npx prettier --write .
```

## Pre-commit Setup (Husky v9+)

Git hooks are managed with Husky and lint-staged.

### Hook Behavior on Commit

- Lints and fixes staged JS/JSX files
- Formats applicable files (JS, JSON, MD, CSS)
- Blocks commit if errors remain after autofix

### Hook Setup

No `npx husky install` needed in Husky v9+. Instead, use:

```
git config core.hooksPath .husky
```

### Pre-commit Script

`.husky/pre-commit`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
npx lint-staged
```

Make sure it is executable:

```
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

To automatically configure this for all developers:

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "git config core.hooksPath .husky"
}
```

## VS Code Recommended Settings

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
}
```

Install the Prettier extension in VS Code.
